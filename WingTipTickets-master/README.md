# Microsoft WingTipTickets Azure Data Platform demo and hands-on-lab

Welcome to the WingTipTickets demo and hands-on-lab project.

These files comprise a hands-on-lab that demostrates a number of the Azure Data Platform services including, Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Data Warehouse, Azure Document DB, Azure Data Factory, Power BI and Azure Search.  WingTipTickets is based sample application used to selling concert tickets and uses this set of services.  Installing this into you're own Azure subscription is a great way to learn about Azure and how you might build applications that consume, transform, and visualize data.

There are two Word documents, one that describes that HOL setup, and another that describes all of the scenarios that can be used as you learn about the platform.

Source-code for the application is also available in the sourcecode sub-directory
